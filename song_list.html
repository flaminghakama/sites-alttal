After several outings at Cafe Van Kleef, we have honed in on the material that works well and are looking forward to our next performance there.<p>
We'll feature songs from our CD, <em>Open the Gates!</em>, unrecorded originals and our favorite cache of mildly obscure covers.

<h3>Catch Me</h3>
</td>

<td colspan=2 valign=top>
<font size=+0>
Although we recorded this for Alt Tal's first
	album, <em>tri</em>, as well as on our current <em>DEMOlish the 
	Wall</em>, it has been out of circulation over the last 
	two years.  We have become very psyched while rehearsing 
	its many sections and investigating its organic 
	relationships.  It is epic, yet joyful: 
<blockquote>Catch me, catch me <br>
            Watch me while I glide<br>
	    Catch me, catch me<br>
	    Open your arms<br>
	    feel the strength inside

<h3>Apricot Admissions</h3>
</td>

<td colspan=2 valign=top>
<font size=+0>
Perhaps our most abstract piece, 
	it has taken us nearly six years to lean to approach 
	it with some assurance, which includes being able to 
        play it without ever playing the melody.
<p>
        We employ freedom of motivic development and accompaniment 
	that abandons the usual convention of linear melodic 
	presentation in favor of on-the-spot mixtues of 
	different melodic fragments, written and implied lines, 
	and a blend of through-composition and free 
	improvisation that generates a fresh shape to the 
	entire piece each time we play it.

The only ballad that appears on <em>Open the Gates!</em>, we like to
throw in <em>Frivolity</em> for some well-deserved repose when things
get heavy.

<blockquote>
It's all a fallen charade.<br>
The way I sit while you cry.

<h3>Gospel</h3>
</td>

<td colspan=2 valign=top>
<font size=+0>
        Steve Lacy is one of my favorite saxophonists, 
	composers, and interpreters of Thelonious Monk.
	I transcribed this piece of his from his album 
	<em>The Rent</em>, which features identical 
	instrumentation to Alt Tal.  I figured it was 
	time to pay tribute to Steve Lacy by actually 
	presenting one of his works.

	<p>
	<em>Gospel</em> swings way super hard, and has a very
	open sound since its melody is based on fourths
	and spans nearly the entire range of the saxophone.  
	The complex head gives way to solos on the standard 
	blues form.

<h3>Promises Kept</h3>
</td>

<td colspan=2 valign=top>
<font size=+0>
        One of my favorite albums is 
	Sonny Sharrock's <em>Ask the Ages</em>, which features
	Pharoah Sanders, Elvin Jones and Charnett Moffett.
	The entire album swings, rocks and grooves like a 
	motherfucker.

	<p>
	I like to think of the first track, <em>Promises Kept</em>, 
	sort of as an example of anthem rock.  It almost 
	sounds like a particularly heavy modal tune, except that
	they do keep the form--most clearly defined by the 
	different feels and hits of each of the three sections.

<h3>Mark Time</h3>
</td>

<td colspan=2 valign=top>
<font size=+0>
A catchy melody interpreted thrice.  A rare example of a 12-bar form that is not based on a blues.  Written for my migrating roommate, Mark Beaver.
<blockquote>
They turn away patrons.<br>
I sit, already sated<br>
But weary and tense, <br>
for lack of Cadence.
<p>
I wish to Mark Time:<br>
to listen, to sleep.<br>
The night needs closure, <br>
a long-awaited weep.
<p>
I must ruch to finish<br>
before loss of grace.<br>
They work in meter <br>
while I set my pace.

<h3>l'Amoureuse de mon P&egrave;re</h3>
</td>

<td colspan=2 valign=top>
<font size=+0>

This song soars, and calls to question.  It has no lyrics because it
is a frantic, swaying escape from words.  The title comes from the
appellation used for Patricia, the object of the song, by her
partner's five-year-old daughter.

<h3>Elaine</h3>
</td>

<td colspan=2 valign=top>
<font size=+0>
The final track on our CD, <em>Elaine</em>, has quite an ecclectic
parantage: it is partAnnie Ross' <em>Twisted</em>, part Ornette
Coleman's <em>Turnaround</em> and part <em>Brady Bunch</em> theme!
<p>
It is also one of those rare creatures, an 11-bar blues.  It's melody
cuts a very witty line, and the arrangement an unpredictable course,
including a duet between drums and soprano saxophone.

<h3>Seven O'Clock Tune</h3>
</td>

<td colspan=2 valign=top>
<font size=+0>
Perhaps the current signature 
	tune of Alt Tal.  Its pan-Persian influences allows 
	us to indulge Kenny's Hindustani musicality, which 
	has rubbed off on me to no small extent.

<h3>The End of Bebop</h3>
</td>

<td colspan=2>
<font size=+0>
	We continue to reinvent this number, originally written in 1995, 
	which begins with a Bebop-style melody that begs to be played twice.
	In a sort of historical acceleration, we proceed to incorporate 
	both Modal and Free Jazz approaches. 
	A challenging and vigorous piece you'll be humming 
	throughout the week.

<h3>India</h3>
</td>

<td colspan=2>
<font size=+0>
	After years of having sights on this tune by John Coltrane, 
        we've finally taken it up.  It is sort of a natural for us, 
	given Kenny and my interest in Hindustani music, and my 
	relatively recent adoption of the soprano saxophone and 
	Kenny's more recent adoption of the acoustic bass.  Not 
	to mention that we are all die-hard Coltrane fans.

	<p>
        More or less a minimalist modal tune, its atmoshphere derives
	from rhythmic dominant and subdominant bass pedal harmonics
        overlaying an insatiable swing.

<h3>Turnaround</h3>
</td>

<td colspan=2>
<font size=+0>
	As you might imagine from the title, Ornette Coleman's 
	<em>Turnaround</em> employs a rather unique turnaround
	within a 12-bar blues form;  it is noticeable both in 
	terms of its anticipated rhythmic placement as well as
	its roving harmonic content.  Another aspect
	I enjoy of <em>Turnaround</em> is its use of 
	both major and minor mode in the subdominant.

<h3>Opus 4</h3>
</td>

<td colspan=2 valign=top>
<font size=+0>
        Charles Mingus would often write tunes first and 
	later apply a title.  This piece, from his 1974 album 
	<em>Mingus Moves</em> apparently did not ever get 
	annointed with a descriptive name.  Imagine how 
	popular this piece would be if it were called
	<em>George Jackson: Freedom Fighter</em>!

	<p>
	Like many of the tunes on <em>Mingus Moves</em>, 
	the chord changes of one section of <em>Opus 4</em> 
        include an ascending chromatic sequence.  Also 
	employed are a dissonant and open 6/4 vamp 
	and an section with a blusey yet lydian melody.

<h3>Indiscipline</h3>
</td>

<td colspan=2 valign=top>
<font size=+0>
        From one of my favorite albums from the 1980s, 
	King Crimson's <em>Discipline</em>, the song 
	<em>Indiscipline</em> is sort of the alter ego of 
	the album.

	<p>
	Despite the title, the song is punctuated with 
	an erratic rhythmic vamp that is ultimately quite
	regular, if disorienting.  This contrasts sharply 
	with the other section, which features an uber-rocking 
	afro-style backbeat over a 5/4 bassline and screaming
	melody that plays incessantly with a major-minor
	inflection.

<h3>The Nymph</h3>
</td>

<td colspan=2 valign=top>
<font size=+0>
The provocatively titled "The Nymph" has an urban and somewhat
sinister pulse, which could be heard as a stripped-down interpretation
of Thelonious Monk's "Epistrophy".
<p>
The riffing melody spans the entire range of the saxophone, and
dissolves into some rather free and characteristic blowing, contrasted
with its finish, which is a startling tihi-like coda.

<h3>Just a Cup of Coffee</h3>

<h3>Nancy</h3>

<em>Nancy</em> is a twenty-bar tune that oscillates between Swing and

Written
way back in 1992 and originally performed by the Lydian People's Front
on their album

<h3>Stomping Ground</h3>
</td>

<td colspan=2>
<font size=+0>
This song emerged during my first trip to San Francisco in 1996,
which was an escape valve from the environs of Akron, Ohio.
<p>
It has a proud melody that questions and examines various
tensions that relate to the minor mode and transcendence 
of it.  Within its long form--64 bars in an AABA structure-- 
the bridge is quite a release, shifting from Latin to Swing
and easing up with the tensions.
<p>
This is another song within our piano trio set.

<h3>This Unmemorable Evening</h3>

An even earlier song, harkening from 1990, <em>This Unmemorable
Evening</em> celebrates the beginning of a romance that took on 
an unlikely and consuming magnitude.

First premiered as part of a five-movement work titled 
<em>A Last Look at Love</em> by the MIT Tech Random Music
Ensemble Jazz Collective, we approach it today as part of 
our piano trio, with a bit more wisdom.

<h3>Sambo, Sambae</h3>
</td>

<td colspan=2>
<font size=+0>
Curiously, <em>Sambo, Sambae</em> has nothing to do with one
or more Sambas.  It is, in fact, a slow, very blues-oriented tune.  
<p>
It  deviates from the blues form by substituting bVII7 for IV7 
in bar two, and bVI for IV7 in bar five, and then goes down fifths-wise 
while the melody maintains a modal inertia, leading to a simultaneous 
dark chordal texture superimposed with a bright and lingering melody.  
<p>
By partially borrowing a rhythmic hook idea from Mingus' <em>Fables of 
Faubus</em>, there are also an "extra" two bars, bringing it to 14 bars 
total.
