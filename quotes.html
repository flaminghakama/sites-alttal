<h1>Alt Tal Reviews and Quotes</h1>

<p>Alt Tal is a San Francisco-based trio comprised of David Alt on soprano and alto, bassist Kenny Annis and drummer Andrew Ryan. Open The Gates features 11 of Alt's originals which range from blues to freer material.</p>
<p>David Alt's playing sometimes recalls that of Steve Lacy and (tone wise on alto) Anthony Braxton but his ideas are fresh and unpredictable. His thoughtful improvisations are consistently relaxed, even in the more heated sections, and have their own logic. To an extent he has created his own musical vocabulary. Kenny Annis alternates between setting accompanying patterns and interacting directly with the saxophonist while Andrew Ryan is mostly in a supportive if stimulating role behind the lead voices.</p>
<p>The music is well played, colorful, and well worth exploring. Open The Gates is available from www. alttal. com.</p>

<p>Keep doing what you're doing!  I especially liked The Nymph (7), Frivolity (8) and Elaine (11).</p>
<p><em>&mdash; Michael Marcus</em></p>
<br>

<p>The music is amazing!  The rhythms are surprising and new ones seem to lurk around the corner.  It's defintely fresh.  The only thing that confused me was there were written lyrics inside, but there is no singing.  </p>
<p>Oh yeah, one more thing.  PLEASE bring ELAINE with you when ever you perform! </p>
<p><em>&mdash; Daveen DiGiacomo</em></p>

<p>It has never happened that I put on your CD, and nobody comes up and asks, "who is that"?</p>
<p><em>&mdash; Patricia Kack</em></p>
<br>

<p>I remembered the time it rained and you and I and someone else were hopping up and down in a puddle of mud...</p>
<p>We decided that hiding from the rain was futile so we stepped right into it, and were soaking wet within minutes, and it seemed the rain would never end...</p>
<p>It is a really nice memory, thank you.</p>
<p><em>&mdash; Valerie Goldburt</em>, about Force of Nature (3)</em></p>

<p>"You're monsters!"<br>
[we got this comment from three separate people]</p>
<p>"I kept looking up to see if it was really a trio&mdash;how could so much music be coming from three people?"</p>
<p>"As good as any Jazz you'll hear in the world."</p>
<p><em>&mdash;From January 2008's audience at Cafe Van Kleef<em></p>
<br>

<p>Your Seven O'Clock Tune is very nicely done&mdash;the Indian music influnece is there but quite subtle, mainly hearing it in some of the shenai like phrasing.  </p>
<p>I think your bass player also plays sarod also. </p>
<p>It's great work.</p>
<p><em>&mdash;Mustafa Stefan Dill</em></p>

<p>"You made my night"<br>
"Thanks for making my night"<br>
[we got this comment from two distinct people]</p>
<p>"I hear all the bands that play here, and of all the 
music in this style, yours is the best."<br>
[from a bartender]</p>
<p><em>&mdash;From March 2008's audience at Cafe Van Kleef</em></p>
<br>

<p>You play the saxophone like nobody else!!!! It is a pleasure listen to you!  Musical kisses from Spain, man!</p>
<p><em>&mdash;Azucena Alonso</em></p>
<br>

<p>Got the CD.  I love the lyric concept.</p>
<p><em>&mdash;Thomas "Tommy D" Doggett</em></p>
<br>

<p>Great performance!  I really enjoyed it-as did my friends.  I liked the caf√©, as well.</p>
